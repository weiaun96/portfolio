## [Project 1: Machine Learning for Uber Lyft rides Price Prediction](https://github.com/weiaun96/uber-lyft-price-prediction-models)
Doing price prediction for Uber and Lyft rides by using R

- This project was done as an academic assignment to create machine learning models by using Rstudio. With an interest in the technology of ride-sharing, I chose a dataset from Kaggle to build the models in an effort to predict prices for Uber rides. The project report is also included in the repository.
- The dataset is retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ravi72munde/uber-lyft-cab-prices).


## [Project 2: Loan Prediction](https://github.com/weiaun96/loan-prediction)
Doing loan approval status prediction based on the characteristics of loan applicants
- This project was done as an academic assignment for Data Analytical Programming.
- It was done using SAS studio.

## [Project 3: Application of Sentiment Analysis for E-commerce Recommendation System](https://github.com/weiaun96/Sentiment-Analysis-in-Recommender-System)
I am currently doing my capstone project for my masters program. With the aim of creating a recommendation system based on sentiment analysis, sentiment scores are extracted from Amazon outdoors product reviews and the results were input as part of the recommendation system for users.
- The dataset used was retrieved from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt).
